### **Background**

The increasing adoption of voice-based technologies has created opportunities for applications that leverage Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities. These technologies make communication more accessible and efficient for users, particularly those with visual impairments or literacy challenges. The app aims to provide a streamlined and user-friendly experience for converting speech into text and vice versa. The application is designed to simplify the interaction process for users, enhancing accessibility and usability through intuitive interfaces. 

### **Problem Statement**

Current speech-based applications often have complex user interfaces and lack customization options, making them difficult to use, especially for people with accessibility needs. There is a need for a simple, efficient, and accessible app that can effectively handle both Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech conversions with minimal user interaction. This project aims to design and develop an app that provides seamless communication through voice and text with user-friendly, high-contrast buttons and customizable settings. 

### **General Objectives**

The general objective of this project is to design and develop a mobile application that enables users to convert speech into text and text into speech in an easy-to-use, intuitive manner, focusing on accessibility and usability for a diverse range of users.

### **Specific Objectives**

- To create a home screen with clear, easy-to-understand navigation between Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionalities.
- To implement an STT feature that allows users to easily record and transcribe spoken words into text.
- To develop a TTS feature where users can input text and have it read aloud with customizable voice settings.
- To ensure accessibility by incorporating features such as high contrast colors, large buttons, and customizable text size.
- To offer user-friendly settings for adjusting voice pitch, speed, and language options in the TTS module.
- To provide users with the ability to easily clear or copy transcribed text in the STT module and clear inputted text in the TTS module.

### **Justification**

With the growing reliance on mobile technologies, an increasing number of users require applications that can bridge communication gaps between spoken and written language. Individuals with disabilities, such as those with visual impairments, benefit greatly from technologies like STT and TTS. However, the complexity of current apps often creates barriers to use. This project aims to address these issues by developing an accessible, user-friendly app, which will cater to a wide range of users, making digital communication more inclusive.

### **Scope and Limitations**

#### **Scope:**

- The project will focus on designing a mobile application for Android platforms.
- It will include features such as STT and TTS with real-time speech transcription, customizable voice settings, and accessible design elements like large buttons and high contrast colors.
- The app will support Swahili language primarily but may offer other languages as the project develops.
- Optional features include an in-app settings screen for voice customization (pitch, speed) and accessibility adjustments.

#### **Limitations:**

- The initial version of the app will be limited to two primary functionalities: Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech.
- The app may not support advanced speech recognition features like punctuation or grammar correction in the initial release.
- Real-time accuracy of STT may vary depending on background noise and accent, which could impact transcription quality.
- Multilingual support beyond Swahili may be limited in the initial development phase.
